# Flood-Risk-Analysis-Using-Satellite-Imagery


Abstractâ€”Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, posing a great threat to agricultural production and rural life. This article proposes a model for flood hazard assessment in farming regions based on satellite data and machine learning models. Through integration of optical and radar satellite data, we recover water indices, vegetation health indexes, and soil moisture to map flood-risk areas. The methodology is tested through past flood patterns in selected farm regions. High accuracy in timely detection and hazard classification is confirmed, and this proves the adequacy of satellite data in underpinning disaster preparedness as well as sustainable agriculture.
